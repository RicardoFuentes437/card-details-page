## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Formik
- Yup
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge i got to work more with Formik and Yup, i learned more about its functionalities, for example how to validate a string with Regex to check if it has only numbers. 

### Continued development

i would like to learn more about Regex because for me that was one of the hardest parts of this challenge, i'm not very familiar with them but they are very useful.

### Useful resources

- [Regex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13973206/regex-for-field-that-allows-numbers-and-spaces) - This helped me with the validation of the card number, allowing only numbers and spaces.
- [Add space every 4 numbers](https://codesandbox.io/s/fancy-credit-card-form-using-formik-bc8r4?file=/src/Form.js) - This helped me with the space every 4 numbers that the card number input has.
